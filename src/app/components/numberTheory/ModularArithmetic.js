      Modular arithmetic is a type of arithmetic where numbers "wrap around" after they
      reach a certain value â€” the modulus. For example, think of an analogue
      clock. 3 hours after 11 is 2, since after reaching 12 it resets to 0.

      Modular arithmetic helps manage the cyclical nature of many processes
      <br />
      <br />
      Cryptography: It's fundamental for algorithms in encryption
      <br />
      <br />
      Hash functions: These use modular arithmetic to convert large datasets
      into fixed-size integers known as hash values
      <br />
      <br />
      Graphics: To create patterns or manage circular arrays
      <br />
      <br />
      Algorithms: To keep integers within a fixed range to prevent overflow
