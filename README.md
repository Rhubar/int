## Welcome to the Interactive Number Theory Playground! (under construction)

This is the start of the Interactive Number Theory Playground portfolio project - a web-based interactive tool that allows users to explore various number theory concepts 
(prime numbers, greatest common divisors, modular arithmetic) and set operations (union, intersection, difference, complement).


The number theory section is complete, set operations are being worked on


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
